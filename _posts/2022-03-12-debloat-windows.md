This projects goal is to aggregate helpful scripts to improve quality of life and privacy of a Windows installation. The goal of this project is to have a single concise tool that you can run and have your Windows up and running with your preferences. You can easily run the script on any Windows installation and improve it by just pasting a single command.

To run the script paste this command into PowerShell (Admin):

```powershell
iwr -useb https://bit.ly/3H3wPVd|iex
```

## Current features:
- Install programs with WinGet
